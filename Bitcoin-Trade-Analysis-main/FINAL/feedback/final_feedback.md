The report is good with all the required results

## **README** 
### Grade

Competent (90%)

### Comments

The README includes all the required linkages, running commands and test suite. Some other information that should be included is how to run the program on the dataset. Since you ask for user IDs, there is no way for me to know what the user IDs are without looking at the data set. It would have been nice to include some information about the dataset in the README to make it easier to understand.

### Comments

The code accomplishes all the goals of the project and is well documented. The efficiency is as expected. There is still some commented code in your repository. It's fine to have that for debugging, but for your final deliverable you should not have commented code. Finally, there was no trivial way of altering the location of your data. It was hard-coded and needs to be changed within the code.
